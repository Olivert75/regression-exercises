    "As a Codeup data science graduate, you want to show off your skills to the Zillow data science team in hopes of getting an interview for a position you saw pop up on LinkedIn. You thought it might look impressive to build an end-to-end project in which you use some of their Kaggle data to predict property values using some of their available features; who knows, you might even do some feature engineering to blow them away. Your goal is to predict the values of single unit properties using the obervations from 2017.\n",
